# Pedal Swap Docker - Phoenix Conversion Progress

## Current Todo List

### Completed ✓
1. ✓ Understand the TypeScript project structure and functionality
   - Analyzed pedal-swap-pnw React/TypeScript bike trading platform
   - Identified key features: browse bikes, list bikes, user profiles, trade system

2. ✓ Map TypeScript components to Phoenix equivalents
   - Decided on hybrid approach: Phoenix backend API + React frontend
   - Will use Phoenix for auth, data persistence, and API

3. ✓ Create database schemas for bikes and users
   - Created migration for users table with profile fields
   - Created migration for bikes table with extended attributes (size, model, wheelset, etc.)
   - Created migration for trades table

4. ✓ Generate Phoenix contexts for bikes and accounts
   - Created User schema with location, strava_id, favorite_ride
   - Created Bike schema with all bike attributes
   - Created Trade schema for bike trading
   - Created Accounts, Bikes, and Trades context modules
   - Added bcrypt_elixir dependency for password hashing

5. ✓ Create API endpoints for bike CRUD operations
   - Built comprehensive REST API with full CRUD for users, bikes, trades
   - Added user authentication endpoint
   - Implemented bike search and filtering
   - Created trade management (accept/reject/cancel)
   - All endpoints tested and working

### Pending ⏳
6. ⏳ Set up TypeScript/React integration with Phoenix
7. ⏳ Copy and adapt React components to Phoenix assets
8. ⏳ Set up authentication system
9. ⏳ Configure asset pipeline for TypeScript
10. ⏳ Create seeds for development data

## Migration Files Created
- `/priv/repo/migrations/20240106120000_create_users.exs`
- `/priv/repo/migrations/20240106120001_create_bikes.exs`
- `/priv/repo/migrations/20240106120002_create_trades.exs`

## Next Steps
1. Create Ecto schemas for User, Bike, and Trade
2. Create context modules (Accounts, Bikes, Trades)
3. Set up bcrypt for password hashing
4. Configure TypeScript compilation in Phoenix
5. Set up API routes

## Notes
- Bash tool is now working correctly
- Database configured with PostgreSQL (simple_app_dev)
- Added bike attributes: size, model, components, wheelset, wheel_size, tire_size
- Tailwind CSS is already configured in Phoenix project
- bcrypt_elixir dependency added for secure password hashing
